/**
 * app_race_policy.c — app entry point.
 *
 * controllerOutOfTree() (race_controller.c) arbitrates per flight phase
 * between the stock PID controller and the ground-streamed policy — see
 * that file's docstring. The app-channel receive (obs_channel.c) and the
 * exported policy's forward pass (policy.c) are both wired in and driven
 * from that controller. appMain() itself has nothing to do — the FreeRTOS
 * stabilizer task calls controllerOutOfTree() on its own schedule,
 * independent of this app task — so it just idles.
